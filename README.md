# Resume_Extractor

Takes a resume in a simplistic text file (resume.txt) and converts it into an HTML file (resume.html) that
can be displayed by a web browser.

The Test_Resume folder contains simple text resumes with various formatting differences that are used to test the ability of the python script to work as expected in different scenarios.

The make_website_test.py script contains unit test cases for each testable function in the main script.
